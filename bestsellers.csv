## 4. Get a “best-selling books” dataset

## Option A – Real dataset (Kaggle or similar)
- Go to your browser and search:  
  **`"amazon bestsellers with categories kaggle"`**  
- Download the CSV file from Kaggle (you may need a free account).
- Save the CSV inside your project folder, e.g. as:
  `bestsellers.csv`

That dataset usually has columns like:

- `Name` – book title  
- `Author`  
- `User Rating` – rating out of 5  
- `Reviews` – number of reviews  
- `Price` – price in \$  
- `Year` – year it was a bestseller  
- `Genre` – Fiction or Non Fiction

## Option B – Make your own small CSV manually (if you don’t want Kaggle yet)

1. Open **Excel** or **Notepad**.
2. Put headers like:

   ```text
   Name,Author,User Rating,Reviews,Price,Year,Genre
   The Alchemist,Paulo Coelho,4.7,24000,10,2015,Fiction
   Becoming,Michelle Obama,4.9,53000,18,2018,Non Fiction
   ...
